Description: Project is supposed to take information from Metacritic, Steam, and HowLongToBeat. An MYSQL database holds the records of what game each individual user has and their overall Steam records as well. We will next send requests to have a scheduled times for play sessions. Using the information from HowLongToBeat will lets us know how much time we need to allocate for each game session we need in order to beat the game.
